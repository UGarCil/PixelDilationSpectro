# PixelDilationSpectro

The program uses Pygame to simulate a simple GUI interface that enables the user to trace the bounding box in which the spectrogram can be found.  
Once a bounding box has been delimited, the program inverts the colors and applies thresholding, following a dilation convolution that makes the lines thicker.
